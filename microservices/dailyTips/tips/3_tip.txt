Light therapy uses exposure to a high illuminating fluorescent bulb. Intensity of light is generally 2,500 to 10,000 lux. Light therapy devices are typically commercially available as “light boxes” that disperse light and filter out ultraviolet rays. Patient positioning and distance from the device and length of daily exposure depend on the manufacturer's specifications and the patient's response to therapy. However, light therapy typically occurs for 30 to 60 minutes at the same time every day, shortly after waking. Patients should face the light but may do other activities, such as reading or exercising, during therapy. Light therapy is considered very low risk (the bright midday sun is equivalent to about 50,000 to 100,000 lux of light), but patients with diseases involving the eyes or who are taking medications that sensitize the eyes to light may benefit from ophthalmology clearance before initiation of therapy. Dawn simulation is an alternative to light therapy that uses a much weaker light (e.g., 250 lux) that is gradually applied at the end of a patient's sleep cycle and as they wake.
