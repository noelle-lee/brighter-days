If you are affected by SAD, it is important to continue your exercise routine as exercise boosts mood. With seasonal affective disorder, it is desirable to continue to exercise or maybe even increase your exercise. Relatively sustained aerobic exercise effects mood positively, but you don’t just have to run or do aerobics – you can do things like yoga, tai chi or meditation, which help with symptoms of depression. You experience low serotonin and dopamine levels in SAD, depression or other conditions, but there is a benefit to boosting neurotransmitter levels through exercise.
