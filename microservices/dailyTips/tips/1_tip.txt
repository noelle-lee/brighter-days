Many people with SAD have insufficient or deficient levels of Vitamin D. During the winter months of November through February, those living about 33 degrees north or 30 degrees south of the equator are not able to synthesize Vitamin D. Research suggests that taking 100,000 IU daily may improve symptoms of SAD. Taking Vitamin D before winter darkness sets in may help prevent symptoms of depression. Adverse reactions or intoxication is rare but could occur from doses of more than 50,000 IU per day.
